# Linear Regression

Learning a linear regression model means estimating the values of the coefficients used in the representation with the data that we have available.

## Formula For a Simple Linear Regression Model
The two factors that are involved in simple linear regression analysis are designated x and y. The equation that describes how y is related to x is known as the regression model.

The simple linear regression model is represented by:

   **y = β0 +β1x+ε**

Where B0 is the bias coefficient and B1 is the slope.
